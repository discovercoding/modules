# modules
> A simple library and binary to get a feel for using modules.

This is very similar to the code in the [crates and modules section of the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/crates-and-modules.html) 
with an error class from the [error handling section of the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/error-handling.html).
